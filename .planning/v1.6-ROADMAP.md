# v1.6 Roadmap: Task Selection Context

**Goal:** Replace the separate Task Chat overlay with task selection awareness in the PM Agent. When a task is selected in the DAG view, the PM agent should automatically know about it and can work with it.

**Depends on:** v1.5 complete

## Phases

### Phase 31: Task Selection Context
Remove separate Task Chat and add selected task context to PM Agent.

**Deliverables:**
- Remove TaskChat component and dialog store state
- Add selectedTaskId to chat context passed to PM Agent
- Update PM agent instructions to understand task selection
- When task is selected in DAG, PM agent automatically knows and can reference it
- "Get selected task" skill behavior: PM responds with task details when asked

**Implementation:**
1. Remove TaskChat component and related imports
2. Remove task chat dialog state from dialog-store
3. Remove "Chat" button from TaskNode
4. Add selectedTaskId to ContextService.getFeatureContext()
5. Update PM agent prompt builder to include selected task details
6. Test: Select task → Ask PM "what task is selected?" → PM responds with task info

## Summary

| Phase | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 31 | Task Selection Context | PM agent knows selected task automatically |
