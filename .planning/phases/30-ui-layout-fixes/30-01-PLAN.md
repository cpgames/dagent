# Plan: UI Layout Fixes

**Phase:** 30-ui-layout-fixes
**Plan:** 01
**Feature:** Fix padding, spacing, and overlap issues throughout the UI

## Context

Phase 30 is the final phase of v1.5, completing the UI Polish milestone. This addresses various layout issues across the application:

1. Task node spacing in DAG view (nodes appear too close together)
2. Title overlap with task nodes
3. "New Feature" button overlap with ProjectSelector input
4. Rename "Play" button to "Start" for clarity
5. General padding/margin audit

**Current state:**
- TaskNode component in DAGView uses 180px min-width
- ExecutionControls has "Play" button text
- Header in App.tsx uses flex justify-between for button layout
- DAGView fitView may cause clustering

## References

- `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` - Header with ProjectSelector and New Feature button
- `src/renderer/src/components/DAG/TaskNode.tsx` - Task node component
- `src/renderer/src/components/DAG/ExecutionControls.tsx` - Play/Start button
- `src/renderer/src/views/DAGView.tsx` - ReactFlow configuration

## Tasks

### Task 1: Rename Play button to Start and improve node spacing

Update ExecutionControls to use "Start" instead of "Play" for clarity. Adjust ReactFlow settings in DAGView to improve node spacing.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/renderer/src/components/DAG/ExecutionControls.tsx`
- Modify: `src/renderer/src/views/DAGView.tsx`

**Implementation:**
1. In ExecutionControls, change line 138 from `'Play'` to `'Start'`
2. Update title attribute for the button (line 135) to say "Start execution"
3. In DAGView, add `nodesDraggable`, `defaultViewport` and `minZoom`/`maxZoom` props to ReactFlow
4. Add `fitViewOptions` with padding to ensure nodes don't cluster at edges

**Verification:**
- Build passes
- Play button now says "Start"
- Nodes have better default spacing when graph loads

### Task 2: Fix header layout and add padding audit

Fix the header layout to prevent potential overlap between ProjectSelector and New Feature button. Apply consistent padding throughout UI elements.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`
- Modify: `src/renderer/src/components/DAG/TaskNode.tsx`

**Implementation:**
1. In App.tsx header, add `gap-4` to the flex container for better spacing
2. Add `shrink-0` to the New Feature button to prevent compression
3. In TaskNode, increase min-width from 180px to 200px for better readability
4. Add border-radius consistency audit (ensure all rounded corners use same scale)

**Verification:**
- Build passes with no TypeScript errors
- Header items have proper spacing and don't overlap
- Task nodes are wider and more readable
- Visual inspection shows consistent spacing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Play" button renamed to "Start"
- [ ] Node spacing improved in DAG view
- [ ] Header layout has proper gaps
- [ ] Task nodes have slightly increased width
- [ ] Build passes with no errors

## Estimated Scope

- 2 tasks
- ~30 lines modified
- ~5 min execution time
