# Phase v3.2-03 Verification Report

## Phase Goal
Asynchronous worktree creation with progress tracking

## Verification Status: PASSED

## Must-Haves Verification

### Truths (Observable Behaviors)

| Truth | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| User clicks Start button on not_started feature card | PASS | FeatureCard.tsx:119 - `showStart = feature.status === 'ready' \|\| feature.status === 'not_started'` |
| Feature status changes to creating_worktree immediately | PASS | feature-handlers.ts:311 - `await manager.updateFeatureStatus(featureId, 'creating_worktree')` |
| Worktree creation happens in background (non-blocking) | PASS | feature-handlers.ts:319-346 - async `.then()/.catch()` without await |
| Feature data is moved from pending to worktree location | PASS | feature-handlers.ts:314 - `await featureStore.moveFeatureToWorktree(featureId)` |
| Feature cards show spinner during creating_worktree state | PASS | FeatureCard.tsx getStatusInfo() returns `showSpinner: true` for creating_worktree |
| Progress messages are displayed during worktree creation | PASS | FeatureCard.tsx uses `worktreeProgress \|\| 'Creating worktree...'` |
| UI remains responsive during worktree creation | PASS | IPC handler returns immediately after starting async operation |
| Status automatically updates when worktree completes | PASS | feature-handlers.ts:324 - `await manager.updateFeatureStatus(featureId, 'investigating')` |

### Artifacts

| Artifact | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| FeatureCard.tsx with handleStartFeature | PASS | Contains `handleStart` function with startWorktreeCreation call |
| feature-handlers.ts with startWorktreeCreation | PASS | Contains `feature:startWorktreeCreation` IPC handler |
| KanbanView.tsx with onWorktreeProgress | PASS | Contains worktreeProgress state and event subscription |
| FeatureCard.tsx with worktreeProgress prop | PASS | Interface has `worktreeProgress?: string` |
| KanbanColumn.tsx with worktreeProgress passthrough | PASS | Passes `worktreeProgress={worktreeProgress?.[feature.id]}` |

### Key Links

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| FeatureCard.tsx | window.electronAPI.feature.startWorktreeCreation | IPC call on Start click | PASS |
| KanbanView.tsx | window.electronAPI.feature.onWorktreeProgress | IPC event subscription | PASS |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| WORKTREE-01: Clicking Start button triggers worktree creation | PASS |
| WORKTREE-02: Worktree creation runs in background (non-blocking UI) | PASS |
| WORKTREE-03: Feature cards show visual progress indicators | PASS |
| WORKTREE-04: Status automatically transitions to investigating | PASS |

## Verification Method
- Grep searches confirmed all artifacts exist in codebase
- Code review confirmed implementation matches requirements
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Build succeeds

## Conclusion
Phase v3.2-03 goal achieved. All 4 requirements implemented and verified.
