# Plan v3.2-03-01 Summary

## Objective
Implement Start button on Kanban cards for not_started features that triggers background worktree creation.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Add Start button for not_started features in FeatureCard
- Updated `showStart` condition to include `not_started` status in addition to `ready`
- Modified `handleStart` to check feature status:
  - For `not_started`: Calls `startWorktreeCreation` IPC handler
  - For `ready`: Keeps existing behavior (updateStatus to in_progress, then start execution)

### Task 2: Create IPC handler for startWorktreeCreation
- Added `feature:startWorktreeCreation` IPC handler in `feature-handlers.ts`
- Handler workflow:
  1. Validates feature is in `not_started` status
  2. Updates status to `creating_worktree` immediately (synchronous)
  3. Moves feature data from pending to worktree location (synchronous)
  4. Starts git worktree creation asynchronously (non-blocking)
  5. Returns immediately with `{ success: true, featureId }`
  6. On worktree creation success: Updates status to `investigating`
  7. On worktree creation failure: Reverts status to `not_started`

### Task 3: Expose startWorktreeCreation in preload
- Added `startWorktreeCreation` method to feature API in `src/preload/index.ts`
- Added type declaration in `src/preload/index.d.ts`
- Return type: `Promise<{ success: boolean; featureId?: string; error?: string }>`

## Files Modified
- `src/renderer/src/components/Kanban/FeatureCard.tsx` - Start button for not_started
- `src/main/ipc/feature-handlers.ts` - New IPC handler
- `src/preload/index.ts` - Preload API method
- `src/preload/index.d.ts` - Type declarations

## Verification
- [x] npm run typecheck passes
- [x] npm run build succeeds
- [x] Start button appears on not_started feature cards in Kanban
- [x] Clicking Start on not_started feature triggers worktree creation

## Commit
```
feat(worktree): add Start button for not_started features to trigger worktree creation
```
