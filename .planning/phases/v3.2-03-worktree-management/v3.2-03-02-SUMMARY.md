# Plan v3.2-03-02 Summary

## Objective
Add visual progress indicators for creating_worktree state and ensure UI updates when worktree creation completes.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Track worktree progress messages in KanbanView
- Added `worktreeProgress` state to track progress messages per feature
- Subscribed to `feature:worktree-progress` events via `window.electronAPI.feature.onWorktreeProgress`
- Progress messages update in real-time as GitManager broadcasts progress
- Passed `worktreeProgress` prop to KanbanColumn

### Task 2: Display progress in FeatureCard for creating_worktree state
- Added `worktreeProgress?: string` prop to FeatureCardProps interface
- Updated `getStatusInfo()` to use worktreeProgress when available
- For creating_worktree state: shows `worktreeProgress || 'Creating worktree...'`
- Spinner continues to display alongside progress message

### Task 3: Update KanbanColumn to pass worktreeProgress to FeatureCard
- Added `worktreeProgress?: Record<string, string>` to KanbanColumnProps
- Destructured worktreeProgress from props
- Passed individual feature progress: `worktreeProgress={worktreeProgress?.[feature.id]}`

## Files Modified
- `src/renderer/src/views/KanbanView.tsx` - Progress state and event subscription
- `src/renderer/src/components/Kanban/FeatureCard.tsx` - Progress prop and display
- `src/renderer/src/components/Kanban/KanbanColumn.tsx` - Progress prop passthrough

## Integration Notes
- The GitManager already broadcasts `feature:worktree-progress` events during worktree creation
- The preload already exposes `onWorktreeProgress` handler
- This plan connects the existing backend events to the UI layer

## Verification
- [x] npm run typecheck passes
- [x] npm run build succeeds
- [x] Feature cards in creating_worktree state show spinner
- [x] Progress messages appear during worktree creation

## Commit
```
feat(kanban): add worktree creation progress display in feature cards
```
