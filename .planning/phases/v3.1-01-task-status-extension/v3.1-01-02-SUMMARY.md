# v3.1-01-02 Summary: Auto-create Task on Feature Creation

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Auto-create initial task in createFeature ✅
- Added `Task` to imports from `@shared/types`
- After `saveFeature()`, creates initial task with:
  - id: `task-${slug}-initial`
  - title: feature name
  - description: feature description (or empty string)
  - status: `needs_analysis`
  - position: `{ x: 250, y: 100 }` (centered)
- Creates initial DAG with single task and empty connections
- Calls `saveDag(id, initialDag)` to persist

### Task 2: Verify DAGGraph type compatibility ✅
- DAGGraph accepts `Task[]` for nodes - no changes needed
- Task type includes `needs_analysis` status from v3.1-01-01

## Additional Fixes
- Updated `src/main/dag-engine/task-pool.ts` - added `needs_analysis: 0` to getCounts()
- Updated `src/renderer/src/components/StatusBadge/StatusBadge.tsx` - added needs_analysis config

## Verification
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] `npm run build` succeeds
- [x] createFeature() saves both feature.json and dag.json
- [x] Initial task has correct structure with needs_analysis status

## Files Modified
- `src/main/storage/feature-store.ts` - Added auto-task creation in createFeature()
- `src/main/dag-engine/task-pool.ts` - Added needs_analysis to getCounts()
- `src/renderer/src/components/StatusBadge/StatusBadge.tsx` - Added needs_analysis config
