# v1.5 Roadmap: UI Polish & Task Chat

**Goal:** Improve DAG view UX with task-level chat, agent visibility, connection management, and layout fixes.

**Depends on:** v1.4 complete

## Phases

### Phase 25: Task Chat Overlay
Add chat panel for individual tasks that overlays the feature chat when a task is opened.

**Deliverables:**
- TaskChat component that appears when task is selected
- Overlay/slide-in animation over FeatureChat
- Task context passed to chat for task-specific conversations
- Back button to return to feature chat

### Phase 26: Agent Logs View
Display communication between agents during task execution.

**Deliverables:**
- AgentLogsPanel component showing agent interactions
- Log entries with timestamps and agent names
- Filter by agent type
- Auto-scroll during active execution

### Phase 27: Resizable Chat Panel
Make Feature Chat (and Task Chat) resizable by dragging.

**Deliverables:**
- Resize handle on left edge of chat panel
- Persist width preference
- Min/max width constraints
- Smooth drag interaction

### Phase 28: Task Agent Badges
Show assigned agents on each task node in the DAG view.

**Deliverables:**
- Agent badges on TaskNode component (Developer, QA, Merge)
- Default agent assignment (non-editable for now)
- Visual indicator of agent roles
- Tooltip with agent descriptions

### Phase 29: Connection Management
Allow users to select and delete connections between tasks.

**Deliverables:**
- Click on edge to select it
- Selected edge styling (highlight)
- Delete button appears at edge center when selected
- Confirmation before deletion
- DAG update and status recalculation after deletion

### Phase 30: UI Layout Fixes
Fix padding, spacing, and overlap issues throughout the UI.

**Deliverables:**
- Fix task node spacing in DAG view (too close together)
- Fix title overlap with task nodes
- Fix "New Feature" button overlap with input
- Rename "Play" button to "Start"
- General padding/margin audit
