# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-13
**Phases:** 1-7
**Total Plans:** 25

## Overview

Build a complete Electron desktop application for dependency-aware AI agent orchestration. Starting with project foundation and data model, then implementing the core DAG execution engine and git integration, followed by the agent coordination system, and finally the UI views and polish.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Working Electron app with React + TypeScript, Tailwind styling, basic window management
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffolding and build configuration
- [x] 01-02: Electron main/renderer process structure
- [x] 01-03: Basic window and IPC setup

**Details:**
- electron-vite chosen over electron-forge for Vite-native integration
- Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- VS Code workaround script for ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE env var

### Phase 2: Data Model & Storage

**Goal**: TypeScript interfaces matching spec, JSON read/write, directory management
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Core type definitions (Feature, Task, Connection, DAGGraph)
- [x] 02-02: JSON file operations and .dagent directory structure
- [x] 02-03: Zustand stores for state management

**Details:**
- @shared path alias for types shared between main/renderer
- Storage requires initializeStorage(projectRoot) before use

### Phase 3: DAG Engine

**Goal**: Dependency resolution algorithm, task status transitions, execution ordering
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Topological sort and dependency resolution
- [x] 03-02: Task state machine (blocked -> ready -> running -> merging -> completed/failed)
- [x] 03-03: Execution orchestration and ready task identification

**Details:**
- Kahn's algorithm for topological sort
- Task state machine per DAGENT_SPEC section 6.4
- Execution orchestrator with task assignment and lifecycle management

### Phase 4: Git Integration

**Goal**: Worktree creation/deletion, branch management, merge operations via simple-git
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Git manager with simple-git setup
- [x] 04-02: Worktree lifecycle (create, delete, list)
- [x] 04-03: Branch operations and merge handling

**Details:**
- simple-git for all git operations
- Worktree lifecycle per DAGENT_SPEC 8.2-8.3
- Merge operations per DAGENT_SPEC 8.4

### Phase 5: Agent System

**Goal**: Agent pool, harness coordination, task/merge agent spawning, intention-approval IPC
**Depends on**: Phase 3, Phase 4
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Agent pool and process management
- [x] 05-02: Harness agent implementation
- [x] 05-03: Task agent with intention-approval workflow
- [x] 05-04: Merge agent for branch integration

**Details:**
- Agent pool with type definitions and slot management
- Harness agent with intention-approval workflow per DAGENT_SPEC section 7
- Task agent with context assembly and worktree isolation
- Merge agent per DAGENT_SPEC 8.4

### Phase 6: UI Views

**Goal**: Kanban board, DAG graph with React Flow, Context editor, node dialogs
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 3
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: App layout and navigation (tab structure)
- [x] 06-02: Kanban view with feature cards
- [x] 06-03: DAG view with React Flow graph
- [x] 06-04: Node dialog and Context view
- [x] 06-05: Feature chat sidebar

**Details:**
- @xyflow/react v12 for DAG visualization
- Custom TaskNode component with status-based styling
- FeatureTabs for feature switching
- NodeDialog for task editing
- FeatureChat sidebar with message history

### Phase 7: Polish & Integration

**Goal**: Auth flow, chat interfaces, undo/redo, error handling, execution controls
**Depends on**: Phase 5, Phase 6
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Authentication priority chain
- [x] 07-02: Play/Stop execution controls
- [x] 07-03: Graph versioning and undo/redo
- [x] 07-04: Error handling and status displays

**Details:**
- AuthManager with 6-level priority chain (Claude CLI -> OAuth env -> stored -> API key -> manual)
- ExecutionControls component for Play/Pause/Stop/Undo/Redo
- HistoryManager with 20-version undo/redo
- Toast, ErrorBoundary, StatusBadge, LoadingSpinner components

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- electron-vite over electron-forge (Vite-native integration)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- @shared path alias for shared types
- React Flow (@xyflow/react) for DAG visualization
- Zustand for state management
- simple-git for git operations

**Issues Resolved:**
- None (clean execution across all phases)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Claude CLI credential detection placeholder (complex, deferred)
