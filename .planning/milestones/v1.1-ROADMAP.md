# Milestone v1.1: Critical Fixes

**Status:** Planning
**Phases:** 8-10
**Estimated Plans:** ~8-10

## Overview

Fix critical blocking issues discovered in v1.0 testing: authentication not initializing, feature creation completely non-functional, and UI polish issues creating a janky experience.

## Phases

### Phase 8: Authentication Fixes

**Goal**: Make authentication actually work - initialize on startup, fix credential detection, show auth status in UI
**Depends on**: v1.0 complete
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: Auth initialization on app startup (main + renderer)
- [ ] 08-02: Fix credential detection (Windows paths, Claude CLI stub)
- [ ] 08-03: Auth status UI (indicator + authentication dialog)

**Issues to fix:**
- App.tsx doesn't call `useAuthStore.initialize()` on startup
- Main process doesn't auto-init AuthManager
- Claude CLI detection always returns null (stub)
- Windows path for Claude CLI config is identical to Unix path
- setCredentials error handler doesn't update error state
- No visual indication of authentication status
- No dialog to prompt user for credentials if auto-detection fails

### Phase 9: Feature Creation

**Goal**: Enable users to create new features from the UI
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01: Feature creation backend (IPC handler, storage method)
- [ ] 09-02: Feature creation dialog component
- [ ] 09-03: Connect "New Feature" button to creation flow

**Issues to fix:**
- "New Feature" button has no onClick handler
- No `createFeature()` method in store, IPC, or storage
- No dialog to collect feature name from user
- No `storage:createFeature` IPC handler
- Feature creation should create git worktree

### Phase 10: UI Polish

**Goal**: Fix UI jankiness - loading states, error display, layout issues, disabled button clarity
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01: Loading states and feedback (spinners, progress indicators)
- [ ] 10-02: Error display and user-friendly messages
- [ ] 10-03: Dirty state tracking and unsaved changes warning
- [ ] 10-04: Layout fixes and placeholder cleanup

**Issues to fix:**
- No loading states during operations
- Errors logged to console, not shown to users
- No dirty state tracking in ContextView
- Disabled buttons show no explanation ("Generate with AI", "Re-evaluate deps")
- Hardcoded "0 tasks" placeholder in FeatureCard
- DAGView never displays errors from dag-store
- Silent IPC failures in multiple stores
- ContextView textarea doesn't expand to fill available screen space
- Layout issues with flex containers not properly sizing children

## Priority

1. **Phase 8** - Auth must work first (blocking all Claude API usage)
2. **Phase 9** - Feature creation is core functionality (can't use app without it)
3. **Phase 10** - Polish improves usability but app is functional without it

## Success Criteria

- [ ] App initializes auth on startup and shows auth status indicator
- [ ] If auth fails, dialog prompts user for API key or OAuth token
- [ ] User can create new features via UI
- [ ] Loading states appear during async operations
- [ ] Errors are displayed to users (not just console)
- [ ] Users warned before losing unsaved changes
- [ ] ContextView textarea fills available screen space
