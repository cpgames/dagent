# Milestone v1.2: UX Overhaul & Core Features

**Status:** In Progress
**Phases:** 11-15
**Estimated Plans:** ~12-15

## Overview

Major UX restructure and core feature implementation. Fix alignment issues, add project selection on startup, implement working feature chat with AI responses, restructure layout with vertical sidebar, and add proper status bar with git information.

## Phases

### Phase 11: Layout Restructure

**Goal**: Move views to vertical right sidebar, add bottom status bar with auth and git info
**Depends on**: v1.1 complete
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 11-01: Create vertical right sidebar with Kanban/DAG/Context view tabs
- [x] 11-02: Create bottom status bar component with layout integration
- [x] 11-03: Move auth indicator to status bar, add git status display

**Issues to fix:**
- Views (Kanban, DAG, Context) should be in vertical right sidebar, not horizontal tabs
- Auth indicator should be in bottom status bar, not header
- Need git status and current branch display in status bar
- Branch selector for switching working branch

### Phase 12: Project Selection

**Goal**: Add startup project selection - open existing or create new project
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 12-01: Project selection dialog component (open folder / create new)
- [ ] 12-02: New project wizard (folder creation, .dagent initialization)
- [ ] 12-03: Recent projects list and project switching

**Issues to fix:**
- App currently auto-opens cwd, no way to select different project
- No way to create new project from UI
- Should show project selection on startup if no recent project

### Phase 13: Feature Chat Implementation

**Goal**: Make feature chat functional with AI responses and persistence
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 13-01: Chat message persistence (save/load from .dagent storage) - COMPLETE
- [ ] 13-02: AI chat integration (send to Claude API, get response) - PLANNED
- [ ] 13-03: Chat context assembly (include feature context, DAG state) - PLANNED

**Issues to fix:**
- User can send messages but receives no response
- Chat messages not persisted between sessions
- Need to send feature context to AI for relevant responses

### Phase 14: Git Branch Management

**Goal**: Full git branch display and switching in status bar
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 14-01: Git status monitoring (branch, clean/dirty, ahead/behind)
- [ ] 14-02: Branch switcher UI (dropdown in status bar, create branch)

**Issues to fix:**
- No visibility into current git state
- Can't switch branches from UI
- Should show if working tree has uncommitted changes

### Phase 15: Alignment & Polish

**Goal**: Fix any remaining alignment issues, polish new layout
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 15-01: Fix layout alignment issues from screenshots
- [ ] 15-02: Final polish and integration testing

**Issues to fix:**
- ContextView textarea still not filling space correctly (from screenshot)
- Any alignment issues in new sidebar layout
- Status bar sizing and responsiveness

- [ ] Bottom status bar with auth indicator and git status
- [ ] Can click branch to switch working branch
- [ ] Project selection dialog on startup
- [ ] Can create new project with folder + .dagent init
