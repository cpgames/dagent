# Milestone v2.1: Kanban Board Improvements

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-15
**Phases:** 47-49
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Improve Kanban board to reflect execution state and add quick-start capability. Features automatically move to the correct column based on task states, and users can start execution directly from Kanban cards without navigating to the DAG view.

## Phases

### Phase 47: Kanban Feature Status

**Goal**: Move features to columns based on task states
**Depends on**: Phase 46 (DAG View Status Badges)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 47-01: Feature Status from Task States

**Details:**
- Created `computeFeatureStatus()` utility with priority rules
- Integrated status updates in orchestrator (emit on every task state change)
- Wired renderer with IPC to receive and apply real-time status updates
- Kanban columns automatically update when tasks progress

### Phase 48: Feature Start Button

**Goal**: Start execution from Kanban card
**Depends on**: Phase 47 (Kanban Feature Status)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 48-01: Start Execution from Kanban Card

**Details:**
- Added Start button with play icon to FeatureCard
- Shows only for not_started and needs_attention features
- Spinner loading state while execution initializes
- Wired through KanbanColumn to execution store

### Phase 49: Kanban UI Polish

**Goal**: Fix padding and spacing issues
**Depends on**: Phase 48 (Feature Start Button)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 49-01: Kanban UI Polish

**Details:**
- Tighter card padding (p-4 → p-3) with hover shadow
- Column backgrounds (bg-gray-900/30) for visual separation
- Styled scrollbars with webkit pseudo-elements
- Empty columns show dashed border placeholder
- Improved container edge padding

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use webkit pseudo-element selectors for scrollbar styling (Tailwind v4 doesn't include scrollbar utilities)
- Show Start button only for features that can be started (not_started, needs_attention)
- Compute feature status with priority rules: failed → needs_attention, all completed → completed, any active → in_progress

**Issues Resolved:**
- None

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
